# Water Quality Monitoring App
This mobile application is my submission to the 24hrs Solve-A-Thon'24 conducted by VIT Chennai Hostel Team.
This is a mobile application designed to monitor water quality parameters such as Turbidity, Temperature, and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). It fetches real-time data from a ThingSpeak channel and provides visualization of the data using line charts. Additionally, the app sends notifications when the TDS , Temperature or Turbidity exceeds a certain threshold.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of water quality parameters.
- Line chart visualization for Turbidity, Temperature, and TDS values.
- Notifications for TDS value exceeding a set threshold.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
